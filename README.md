# VRBO CRAWLER

## Task 
Write a script that will get 50 closest listings from https://www.vrbo.com/ - also get their nightly prices for the next 12 months and save them in a CSV file - you will have to find the API calls that you need to make (reverse engineer the calls from the browser)

## Sample address
Pick an address and a radius. For example, assume the location is at "73 W Monroe St, Chicago, IL USA" and has a radius of 2 KM.
